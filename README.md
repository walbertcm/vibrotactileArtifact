# Vibrotactile Device for Experiments

This repository contains the hardware design, algorithms, and scripts developed for the vibrotactile device described in **Chapter 4** of the doctoral thesis *Design Practices for Encoding Abstract Data Using Vibrotactile Patterns*.  
The device was conceived as an experimental platform to support controlled user studies on vibrotactile perception, including limits, scales, and data encoding tasks.

## 📌 Overview
The vibrotactile device provides:
- Delivery of controlled vibrotactile patterns using multiple actuators (ERM motors).
- Support for frequency, duration, rhythm, and spatial arrangements.
- Integration with Arduino/ESP32 microcontrollers.
- Button interface for user responses.
- Modular design for experimental reproducibility.
